Pattern Name: Behavioral Design Patterns
Pattern Category: Overview

Description:
    - Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.
    - They help you manage complex object interactions and algorithms while keeping objects loosely coupled.
    - These patterns deal with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and the communication between them.
    - They provide ways to organize code for better communication and flexibility.

The key idea is:
    - "Manage object interactions and communication while keeping objects loosely coupled and responsibilities well-distributed."

The Problem:
    - You need to manage complex object interactions and communication.
    - You want to avoid tight coupling between objects.
    - You need to distribute responsibilities appropriately.
    - You want to make object behavior flexible and extensible.
    - You need to handle complex algorithms and state management.

The Solution:
    - Use patterns that define how objects communicate and interact.
    - Separate concerns and responsibilities clearly.
    - Create flexible communication mechanisms.
    - Build systems that can evolve without major refactoring.
    - Use patterns that promote loose coupling and high cohesion.

What This Overview Does:
This overview provides a comprehensive guide to all behavioral design patterns, explaining their purposes, relationships, and when to use each one. It serves as a roadmap for understanding and implementing behavioral patterns effectively.

Step-by-Step Pattern Guide:

1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern (chain-of-responsibility/)
   - Purpose: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it
   - Key Idea: Creates a chain of handler objects for request processing
   - Use Case: When you need to route requests through multiple handlers
   - Files: SupportRequest, SupportHandler, Level1Support, Level2Support, Level3Support, Main

2. Command Pattern (command/)
   - Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object
   - Key Idea: Decouples the invoker from the receiver
   - Use Case: When you need to parameterize objects with operations
   - Files: Command, Light, LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand, RemoteControl, NoCommand, Main

3. Interpreter Pattern (interpreter/)
   - Purpose: Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions
   - Key Idea: Defines a representation for grammar with an interpreter
   - Use Case: When you need to interpret expressions in a simple language
   - Files: Expression, NumberExpression, AddExpression, SubtractExpression, ExpressionParser, Main

4. Iterator Pattern (iterator/)
   - Purpose: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
   - Key Idea: Decouples collection from iteration logic
   - Use Case: When you need to traverse collections without exposing internals
   - Files: Iterator, Container, NameRepository, Main

5. Mediator Pattern (mediator/)
   - Purpose: Defines an object that encapsulates how objects interact
   - Key Idea: Centralizes complex communications between objects
   - Use Case: When you need to reduce coupling between interacting objects
   - Files: ChatMediator, User, ChatUser, ChatMediatorImpl, Main

6. Memento Pattern (memento/)
   - Purpose: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state
   - Key Idea: Provides ability to restore objects to previous states
   - Use Case: When you need to implement undo/redo functionality
   - Files: Memento, Originator, CareTaker, Main

7. Observer Pattern (observer/)
   - Purpose: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
   - Key Idea: Objects are notified automatically when subject changes
   - Use Case: When you need to maintain consistency between related objects
   - Files: Subject, Observer, NewsAgency, NewsChannel, Main

8. State Pattern (state/)
   - Purpose: Allows an object to alter its behavior when state changes
   - Key Idea: Appears as if object changed its class
   - Use Case: When you have objects with multiple states and behaviors
   - Files: State, Context, StartState, StopState, Main

9. Strategy Pattern (strategy/)
   - Purpose: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
   - Key Idea: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them selectable at runtime
   - Use Case: When you have multiple algorithms for the same task
   - Files: Strategy, OperationAdd, OperationSubtract, OperationMultiply, Context, Main

10. Template Method Pattern (template-method/)
    - Purpose: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method
    - Key Idea: Lets subclasses redefine certain steps without changing structure
    - Use Case: When you have algorithms with fixed structure but variable steps
    - Files: Game, Cricket, Football, Main

11. Visitor Pattern (visitor/)
    - Purpose: Represents an operation to be performed on object structure
    - Key Idea: Defines new operations without changing element classes
    - Use Case: When you need to perform operations without modifying element classes
    - Files: ComputerPart, ComputerPartVisitor, Keyboard, Monitor, Mouse, Computer, ComputerPartDisplayVisitor, Main

Real-World Example: Event-Driven Application Architecture

Imagine you're building a complex application that:
- Has multiple components that need to communicate
- Requires flexible event handling and state management
- Needs to support undo/redo operations
- Should handle user interactions dynamically
- Must be extensible for new features

Without Behavioral Patterns:
You'd have tightly coupled components, complex communication logic, and difficulty managing object interactions!

With Behavioral Patterns:
You can build flexible, maintainable systems with clean communication and well-distributed responsibilities!

Benefits:
- Loose Coupling: Objects interact without tight dependencies
- Flexibility: Behavior can be changed at runtime
- Extensibility: New behaviors can be added easily
- Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
- Reusability: Patterns can be applied across different contexts

Use Cases:
- Event Handling: Managing complex event flows
- State Management: Handling object state changes
- Communication: Coordinating object interactions
- Algorithm Selection: Choosing algorithms at runtime
- Behavioral Extension: Adding new behaviors to existing systems

Drawbacks:
- Complexity: Can add complexity if overused
- Learning Curve: Requires understanding of pattern relationships
- Performance: Some patterns add overhead
- Debugging: Can make debugging more complex
- Object Proliferation: May create many small objects

How to Use This Guide:
1. Start with the overview to understand behavioral patterns
2. Identify your specific communication or interaction problem
3. Choose the pattern that best fits your use case
4. Navigate to the specific pattern folder
5. Study the example and README
6. Implement the pattern in your code

Key Takeaways:
1. Communication Focus: Behavioral patterns focus on object communication
2. Loose Coupling: Patterns promote loose coupling between objects
3. Responsibility Distribution: Clear assignment of responsibilities
4. Runtime Flexibility: Many patterns support runtime behavior changes
5. Choose Wisely: Use the simplest pattern that solves your problem

Behavioral Pattern Relationships:
- Observer vs Mediator: Both handle communication, but Observer is one-to-many notification, while Mediator centralizes communication
- Strategy vs State: Both use delegation, but Strategy changes algorithms, while State changes behavior
- Command vs Chain of Responsibility: Both handle requests, but Command encapsulates requests, while Chain routes them through handlers
