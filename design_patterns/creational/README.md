Creational Design Patterns in Java

This project demonstrates the five core Creational Design Patterns using practical, beginner-friendly Java examples.

👨‍💻 Included Patterns:

Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
📁 Folder: singleton
🧪 Example: CloudConfigManager – loads configuration only once.

Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
📁 Folder: factorymethod
🧪 Example: TransportFactory – creates Car or Bike based on input.

Abstract Factory Pattern
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
📁 Folder: abstractfactory
🧪 Example: UIFactory – creates UI components for Windows or Mac.

Builder Pattern
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing step-by-step creation.
📁 Folder: builder
🧪 Example: HttpRequestBuilder – builds an HTTP request object with optional headers and body.

Prototype Pattern
Allows object creation by copying an existing object, used when creating a new object is costly.
📁 Folder: prototype
🧪 Example: ReportDocument – clones a document template for reuse.

🧠 Why Use Creational Patterns?

 * Encapsulate object creation logic

 * Promote code reuse and maintainability

 * Reduce complexity in large systems

 * Enable greater flexibility and decoupling
